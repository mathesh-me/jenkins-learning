## CI CD

### What is CI CD?

-   CI CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by
    introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main
    concepts attributed to CI CD are continuous integration, continuous
    delivery, and continuous deployment.

### Continuous Integration

-   Continuous Integration is a software development practice where
    members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each
    person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations
    per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build
    (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as
    possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly
    reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive
    software more rapidly.

### Continuous Delivery

-   Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you
    build software in such a way that the software can be released to
    production at any time. You’re doing continuous delivery when:

    -   Your software is deployable throughout its lifecycle

    -   Your team prioritizes keeping the software deployable over
        working on new features

    -   Anybody can get fast, automated feedback on the production
        readiness of their systems any time somebody makes a change to
        them

    -   You can perform push-button deployments of any version of the
        software to any environment on demand

### Continuous Deployment

-   Continuous Deployment is very similar to Continuous Delivery. The
    only difference is that with Continuous Deployment, your team
    **automatically** deploys each change that passes the automated
    tests. Continuous Deployment is an excellent way to accelerate the
    feedback loop with your customers and take pressure off the team as
    there isn’t a Release Day anymore. Developers can focus on building
    software, and they see their work go live minutes after they’ve
    finished working on it.

### CI CD Pipeline

-   A CI CD pipeline is a sequence of steps that must be performed to
    deliver a new version of software. It begins with committing code to
    a version control repository and ends with deploying the application
    to production.
